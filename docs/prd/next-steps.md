# Next Steps

### For UX Expert

You are being engaged to translate the Paw Patrol Product Requirements Document into a comprehensive user experience design that prioritizes field usability and rapid implementation.

**Your Mission:**
Design a mobile-first, field-optimized interface for community cat rescue volunteers that enables one-handed operation in challenging outdoor conditions while maintaining visual clarity and intuitive navigation.

**Context:**
- **Product:** Paw Patrol - GIS-based community cat colony tracking platform
- **Users:** Rescue volunteers in the Philippines working outdoors with limited connectivity
- **Timeline:** 1-month MVP development sprint (design must support rapid implementation)
- **Platform:** Web responsive (mobile-first), no native apps

**Key Design Constraints:**
1. **Field-First Design:** Large touch targets, high contrast for outdoor visibility, minimal data entry
2. **One-Handed Operation:** All critical actions within thumb reach on mobile devices
3. **Photo-Forward:** Cat images are primary navigation cues and identification method
4. **Speed Over Polish:** Functional, clean design prioritized over aesthetic refinement
5. **Technology:** Tailwind CSS + Untitled UI component library (use existing components)

**Reference Sections in PRD:**
- **UI Design Goals** (lines 393-443): Complete UX vision, interaction paradigms, 10 core screens
- **Functional Requirements** (FR1-FR55): All UI interactions and workflows
- **Epic Stories**: Detailed acceptance criteria for each screen and component

**Design Deliverables Needed:**
1. **High-Fidelity Mockups** for 10 core screens:
   - Interactive Map (home), Colony Details, Cat Profile, Add Cat Form, Log Activity Form, Filter Panel, Search Results, Admin Verification Panel, Login/Registration, Bottom Sheet Navigation
2. **Mobile Interaction Patterns:**
   - Long-press colony creation (500ms), FAB button placement, bottom sheet modal behavior, photo gallery swipe navigation
3. **Visual Design System:**
   - Color palette (status indicators: green/amber/red for feeding status, medical alerts)
   - Typography scale for mobile readability
   - Icon set (map pins, action buttons, status badges)
   - Component library usage guide (Untitled UI components)
4. **User Flow Diagrams** for 3 core journeys:
   - New User: Registration → Verification → First Colony Creation
   - Daily Feeding: Map → Colony Details → Log Activity → View Fed Today Status
   - TNR Coordination: Search → Filter by Unneutered → Cat Profile → Check TNR Info
5. **Responsive Breakpoints:**
   - Mobile: 375px-428px (primary)
   - Tablet: 768px-1024px (functional)
   - Desktop: 1280px+ (functional but not optimized)

**Critical UX Requirements:**
- Map load time <3 seconds (NFR1)
- Activity logging <10 seconds end-to-end (NFR2-3)
- No formal accessibility compliance required (NFR - "Target Level: None")
- Support last 2 versions Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

**Design Philosophy:**
Think "hiking GPS app" not "social media feed" - prioritize utility, speed, and clarity over aesthetic polish. Every pixel must serve a functional purpose. Design for volunteers wearing gloves, in bright sunlight, with one hand holding food/supplies.

**Success Criteria:**
- Designs can be implemented in 1 month using Tailwind CSS + Untitled UI
- Volunteers can log feeding activity in <10 seconds without looking at screen
- New users can create first colony within 2 minutes of login
- Zero training required for basic operations (search, view colony, log activity)

**Next Actions:**
1. Review full PRD (especially UI Design Goals and Epic Stories 2-5 for screen details)
2. Create mobile-first wireframes for 10 core screens
3. Design visual language (colors, typography, iconography)
4. Develop high-fidelity mockups with Untailed UI components
5. Document interaction patterns and component specifications for developer handoff

### For Architect

You are being engaged to design the technical architecture for Paw Patrol, a GIS-based community cat colony tracking platform, based on the completed Product Requirements Document.

**Your Mission:**
Design a scalable, maintainable architecture that supports a 1-month MVP development timeline while providing clear upgrade paths for post-MVP enhancements.

**Context:**
- **Product:** Community cat rescue coordination platform with interactive mapping
- **Timeline:** 1-month MVP sprint (aggressive, minimal buffer)
- **Team:** Solo developer (AI-assisted implementation)
- **Scale:** 10-20 colonies, 5-15 cats each during pilot; plan for 100+ colonies post-MVP
- **Budget:** Render free tier initially → $25-50/month paid tier if needed

**Technology Stack (Pre-Selected):**
- **Backend:** Java 17+, Spring Boot 3.x, PostgreSQL 15+, JWT authentication
- **Frontend:** Vite, React 18+, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Untitled UI components
- **Deployment:** Render (Web Service + Static Site + Managed PostgreSQL)
- **External APIs:** Google Maps Platform (Maps, Geocoding, Places APIs)
- **Storage:** Local filesystem (Render persistent disk) for MVP → S3/R2 post-MVP

**Reference Sections in PRD:**
- **Technical Assumptions** (lines 467-585): Complete stack rationale, security, testing strategy
- **Functional Requirements** (FR1-FR55): All system capabilities and interactions
- **Non-Functional Requirements** (NFR1-NFR18): Performance, security, scalability targets
- **Epic Stories** (5 epics, 58 stories): Detailed acceptance criteria for implementation

**Architecture Deliverables Needed:**

1. **Database Schema Design:**
   - Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for: User, Colony, Cat, CatHealthInfo, CatTnrInfo, Activity, Photo entities
   - Foreign key relationships, indexes on query-heavy fields (lat/long, status, timestamps)
   - Audit trail strategy (createdBy, updatedBy, deletedAt for soft deletes)
   - Migration approach (Flyway or Liquibase)

2. **API Specification:**
   - RESTful endpoint design for all CRUD operations (colonies, cats, activities, photos, users)
   - Request/response schemas (JSON format)
   - Authentication flow (JWT token generation, refresh strategy, protected routes)
   - Error response standards (4xx client errors, 5xx server errors with consistent structure)
   - API versioning strategy (`/api/v1/` prefix)

3. **Component Architecture:**
   - React component hierarchy (Map, ColonyDetails, CatProfile, ActivityLog, FilterPanel, etc.)
   - State management approach (React Context API vs Zustand - recommend one with rationale)
   - Routing strategy (React Router with protected routes)
   - API integration layer (Axios with interceptors for auth token injection)

4. **Integration Architecture:**
   - Google Maps JavaScript API integration (API key management, rate limiting, error handling)
   - Geocoding API usage for reverse address lookup
   - Email service integration (SendGrid or SMTP for password reset)
   - File upload flow (multipart form data → validation → optimization → storage)

5. **Security Architecture:**
   - Authentication flow: Registration → Admin Verification → Login → JWT Token → Protected Resources
   - Password hashing (BCrypt), token signing (HMAC SHA256)
   - CORS configuration, CSRF protection strategy
   - File upload validation (MIME type whitelist, file size limits, malicious file prevention)
   - SQL injection prevention (JPA parameterized queries)

6. **Performance & Optimization Strategy:**
   - Database indexing plan (colonies: lat/long, cats: status, activities: timestamp)
   - Query optimization for complex filters (Status + Health + TNR + Behavior + Gender)
   - Image optimization pipeline (resize to 1920px, compress to 80% JPEG, generate thumbnails)
   - Map marker clustering for dense colony areas (MarkerClusterer)
   - Pagination strategy for activity logs (50 items per page)

7. **Deployment Architecture:**
   - Render Web Service configuration (build command, start command, environment variables)
   - Render Static Site configuration (build output directory, redirects for SPA routing)
   - Database connection pooling and migration execution
   - HTTPS configuration (automatic via Render/Let's Encrypt)
   - CI/CD pipeline (auto-deploy on Git push to main)

**Critical Technical Requirements:**
- Map load time <3 seconds on 4G (NFR1)
- Activity logging <2 seconds without photos, <5 seconds with photos (NFR2-3)
- Support 10-20 colonies without performance degradation (NFR17)
- Stay within Render free tier / Google Maps $200/month credit during pilot (NFR13-14)

**Known Technical Challenges:**
1. **Haversine Distance Calculation** (FR13, Story 4.10): Straight-line distance for search result proximity
   - Solution: PostgreSQL query with lat/long formula or PostGIS extension (if needed)
2. **Complex Filter Query Builder** (Epic 5): Multiple JOINs across Colony, Cat, CatHealthInfo, CatTnrInfo, Activity
   - Solution: JPA Criteria API or native SQL with proper indexing
3. **Concurrent Edit Handling** (FR46): Last-write-wins strategy for cat profiles and activities
   - Solution: Optimistic locking with version field or timestamp comparison
4. **Google Maps API Cost Monitoring**: Stay within free tier during pilot
   - Solution: Usage tracking, caching geocoding results, rate limiting

**MVP Simplifications to Preserve:**
- Search and filters operate independently (mutually exclusive, not combined) - Epic 5 Story 5.9
- Fed Today uses rolling 24-hour window (not timezone-aware day boundaries) - Epic 4 Story 4.9
- Activity logs are immutable (no edit/delete for MVP) - MVP Scope Clarification
- Behavioral notes are free-text (no predefined tags) - Epic 5 Story 5.5

**Post-MVP Upgrade Paths to Plan For:**
- Combined search + filter queries (FR15 full implementation)
- Timezone-aware Fed Today calculation (GMT+8 midnight reset)
- Editable activity logs with version history (FR44-45)
- Structured temperament tags and age ranges (FR22-23)
- Cloud object storage migration (S3/R2)

**Success Criteria:**
- Architecture supports 1-month implementation timeline
- Database schema is normalized and scalable to 100+ colonies
- API design is RESTful and enables future mobile app development
- Security architecture meets NFR6-10 requirements
- Performance targets (NFR1-3) are achievable with proposed design

**Next Actions:**
1. Review full PRD (especially Epic Stories for detailed acceptance criteria)
2. Design database schema with ERD and migration scripts
3. Define REST API endpoints with request/response specifications
4. Create component architecture diagram for React frontend
5. Document integration points (Google Maps, email, file storage)
6. Provide implementation guidance for high-complexity areas (Haversine distance, filter queries, concurrent edits)
7. Create deployment checklist for Render platform
