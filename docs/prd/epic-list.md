# Epic List

The following epics represent the logical sequence of development work required to deliver the Paw Patrol MVP. Each epic delivers a significant, end-to-end increment of testable functionality that builds upon previous work.

**Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication**
Establish project infrastructure, database schema, authentication system, and user verification workflow to enable secure access to the platform.

**Epic 2: Interactive Map & Colony Management**
Implement the core map interface with colony creation, viewing, and management capabilities to enable users to track cat colony locations.

**Epic 3: Cat Profiles & Management**
Build comprehensive cat profile system with CRUD operations, photo galleries, and status tracking to enable detailed individual cat record keeping.

**Epic 4: Activity Logging & Search**
Enable activity logging for colonies and cats, implement search functionality, and provide activity log viewing and filtering to support coordination and record keeping.

**Epic 5: Advanced Filtering & Admin Tools**
Implement advanced filtering capabilities and admin verification panel to complete the MVP feature set and enable pilot testing.

**Rationale for Epic Structure:**

- **Epic 1** establishes the foundation (project setup, security, user management) while delivering the registration and authentication workflow
- **Epic 2** builds the core map interface and colony management, which is the primary user entry point
- **Epic 3** adds cat profiles, which depend on colonies existing
- **Epic 4** adds activity logging and search, which depend on both colonies and cats existing
- **Epic 5** completes the platform with filtering and admin tools needed for pilot testing

**Epic Sizing:** Each epic is scoped for approximately 1 week of development effort in a 4-week timeline, with buffer time for testing and deployment.

**Alternative Consideration:** These 5 epics could be consolidated into 3-4 larger epics if you prefer fewer high-level milestones. For example:
- Merge Epic 2 & 3 into "Core Colony & Cat Management"
- Merge Epic 4 & 5 into "Activity Logging & Platform Completion"
