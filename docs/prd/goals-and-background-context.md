# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Primary Goal:** Enable geolocation tracking of cat colonies with accessible, detailed information for each colony and individual cat accessible through an interactive map interface
- Provide centralized, real-time information system where volunteer rescuers can access up-to-date colony data and activity logs from any device
- Improve record keeping for community cat populations to support TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) efforts and adoption opportunities
- Implement secure manual verification system to ensure only legitimate rescuers access sensitive colony location data and maintain community trust
- Deploy working prototype for personal use within 1 month, then onboard 5-10 pilot testers to validate core workflows before proposing to volunteer rescue groups
- Create a freely adoptable platform that volunteer groups can implement for their own coordination needs without profit motive

### Background Context

Community cat caretakers in the Philippines currently face severe coordination challenges due to fragmented information sharing through notebooks, messaging apps, and memory. This results in duplicated feeding efforts, inconsistent health monitoring, gaps in TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) coordination, and lost institutional knowledge when volunteers leave. 

The Paw Patrol platform addresses this by providing a GIS (Geographic Information System) specifically designed for community cat welfareâ€”an interactive map where colonies are pinned to real-world locations, each serving as a gateway to rich, structured data about individual cats. The centralized system enables real-time updates and comprehensive record keeping that supports both TNR efforts and adoption placement by preserving detailed cat histories and health information.

No comparable solution currently exists in the market specifically designed for community cat rescue coordination. While the platform is designed for broader applicability to any geographic region, real-world testing and validation will be conducted with rescue volunteers in the Philippines. The project is a non-profit initiative intended to be freely adopted by volunteer rescue groups to improve their coordination and animal welfare outcomes.

The MVP will be built using Java/Spring Boot backend, Vite/React frontend, and PostgreSQL database, deployed on Render with Google Maps Platform integration.
