# Post-MVP Feature Candidates

The following features were identified during requirements analysis as valuable enhancements for future versions, to be prioritized based on pilot testing feedback:

### Coordination & Efficiency Features

**Multi-Colony Route Planning:**
- "Plan Feeding Route" feature to optimize visits to multiple colonies efficiently (Google Maps-style route optimization)
- Help volunteers minimize travel time and fuel costs when servicing multiple locations
- Display estimated travel time and distance for planned routes

**Recent Activity Feed:**
- Home screen or map overlay showing recent activities from nearby colonies
- Improve real-time coordination by making recent feedings/TNR visible at a glance
- Filter by activity type and proximity radius

**Neighborhood/Barangay Tagging:**
- Optional geographic grouping tags for colonies beyond just distance-based filtering
- Enable local coordination within specific neighborhoods or administrative areas
- Support community-level reporting and organization

### Data Quality & Transparency Features

**Cat Profile Completeness Indicators:**
- Display profile completion percentage (e.g., "Profile 80% Complete")
- Highlight missing critical fields (TNR date, health info, photos)
- Encourage comprehensive data entry for better care coordination

**Activity Log Version History:**
- Track what fields were changed in activity log edits for transparency
- Display edit history showing "User changed timestamp from 8:00 AM to 8:30 AM"
- Support rollback to previous versions if errors occur

**Profile Edit History:**
- Version history for cat profile changes (similar to Wikipedia edit history)
- Show who made what changes and when for accountability
- Enable discussion or notes on controversial edits

### Privacy & Access Control Features

**Private Colony Toggle:**
- Allow users to mark colonies as "Private" (e.g., colonies at personal home addresses)
- Private colonies only visible to creator and explicitly granted users
- Critical safety feature as platform scales beyond trusted pilot group

**Colony Manager Role:**
- Dedicated role with exclusive edit permissions for specific colonies
- Restricts who can modify colony names, cat profiles, and critical data
- Reduces risk of conflicting edits or vandalism as community grows

**Geographic Access Restrictions:**
- Per-colony or per-group visibility controls
- Support rescue organizations wanting data accessible only to their members
- Enable federation model where groups control their own data while on shared platform

### Engagement & Gamification Features

**Cat Collection System:**
- Badges or achievements for first-time colony visits
- Encourage field coverage and discovery of new colonies
- "Caught 'Em All" mechanics for visiting multiple colonies

**Volunteer Recognition:**
- Activity leaderboards or contribution metrics
- Highlight most active feeders, TNR advocates, or data contributors
- Foster positive competition and community engagement

### Advanced Features for Scale

**Watchlists & Notifications:**
- Users can "watch" specific colonies and receive notifications of changes
- Alert volunteers when colonies need attention (no feeding in 24+ hours)
- Reduce coordination overhead through proactive alerts

**Discussion/Comments System:**
- Per-colony or per-cat discussion threads
- Allow volunteers to discuss care strategies, health concerns, or coordinate efforts
- Alternative to informal messaging app groups

**Profile Quality Ratings:**
- Community-driven quality indicators for cat profiles
- "Verified" badges for cats with complete TNR records and recent photos
- Help identify which profiles need updates or verification

### Analysis & Reporting

**Analytics Dashboard:**
- Aggregate statistics on TNR progress, feeding frequency, volunteer activity
- Support grant applications and impact reporting for rescue organizations
- Geographic heatmaps showing coverage gaps or high-need areas

**Export & Integration:**
- Data export for backup or migration
- API for third-party integrations (vet clinics, donation platforms)
- Support rescue organizations' existing workflows

**Priority Note:** These features should be evaluated after MVP pilot testing to determine which provide the most value to actual users vs. theoretical benefits. User feedback will guide Phase 2 prioritization.
