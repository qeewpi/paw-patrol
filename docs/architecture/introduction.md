# Introduction

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status:** N/A - Greenfield project

This is a greenfield project with the technology stack already defined in the PRD and project brief:

- **Frontend:** Vite + React with Tailwind CSS and Untitled UI component library
- **Backend:** Java 17+ with Spring Boot 3.x framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15+
- **Hosting:** Render (web services, static site, managed PostgreSQL)
- **Mapping:** Google Maps Platform APIs

The project will use a **monorepo structure** with /backend and /frontend directories to facilitate:
- Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend
- Simplified deployment with single repository CI/CD
- Code reuse for validation logic, constants, and utilities
- Improved developer experience working across both ends

No starter template is being used; the architecture is purpose-built for community cat rescue coordination requirements.
