# Paw Patrol Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Primary Goal:** Enable geolocation tracking of cat colonies with accessible, detailed information for each colony and individual cat accessible through an interactive map interface
- Provide centralized, real-time information system where volunteer rescuers can access up-to-date colony data and activity logs from any device
- Improve record keeping for community cat populations to support TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) efforts and adoption opportunities
- Implement secure manual verification system to ensure only legitimate rescuers access sensitive colony location data and maintain community trust
- Deploy working prototype for personal use within 1 month, then onboard 5-10 pilot testers to validate core workflows before proposing to volunteer rescue groups
- Create a freely adoptable platform that volunteer groups can implement for their own coordination needs without profit motive

### Background Context

Community cat caretakers in the Philippines currently face severe coordination challenges due to fragmented information sharing through notebooks, messaging apps, and memory. This results in duplicated feeding efforts, inconsistent health monitoring, gaps in TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) coordination, and lost institutional knowledge when volunteers leave. 

The Paw Patrol platform addresses this by providing a GIS (Geographic Information System) specifically designed for community cat welfare—an interactive map where colonies are pinned to real-world locations, each serving as a gateway to rich, structured data about individual cats. The centralized system enables real-time updates and comprehensive record keeping that supports both TNR efforts and adoption placement by preserving detailed cat histories and health information.

No comparable solution currently exists in the market specifically designed for community cat rescue coordination. While the platform is designed for broader applicability to any geographic region, real-world testing and validation will be conducted with rescue volunteers in the Philippines. The project is a non-profit initiative intended to be freely adopted by volunteer rescue groups to improve their coordination and animal welfare outcomes.

The MVP will be built using Java/Spring Boot backend, Vite/React frontend, and PostgreSQL database, deployed on Render with Google Maps Platform integration.

## MVP Scope Clarifications

The following requirements have simplified MVP implementations with full versions deferred to post-MVP based on development timeline:

### Search and Filter Interaction (FR15)

**MVP Implementation:**
- Search and filters operate independently (mutually exclusive modes)
- User can either search OR apply filters, not both simultaneously
- Switching between search and filter clears the previous operation

**Full Implementation (Post-MVP):**
- Combined search + filter operations (e.g., search "Tabby" AND filter by "Neutered")
- Complex query logic supporting multiple simultaneous criteria
- Persistent filter state while searching

**Rationale:** Independent search/filter is simpler to implement and test; combined operations require complex SQL/backend query building.

---

### Feeding Status Calculation (FR19-FR20)

**MVP Implementation:**
- "Fed Today" defined as feeding activity logged within last 24 hours from current time
- Simple timestamp comparison: `now() - feeding_timestamp < 24 hours`
- No timezone adjustments or day boundary logic

**Full Implementation (Post-MVP):**
- Timezone-aware "Fed Today" using Philippines timezone (GMT+8)
- Resets at midnight Philippines time, not rolling 24-hour window
- Accurate for coordination across different user timezones

**Rationale:** Rolling 24-hour window is simpler and functionally equivalent for single-timezone pilot testing; timezone logic adds complexity.

---

### Temperament and Age Range Tagging (FR22-FR23)

**MVP Implementation:**
- **Temperament:** Free-text field for behavioral notes (no predefined tags)
- **Age Range:** Free-text or simple dropdown with basic options (Kitten, Adult, Senior)
- Filter by text search within behavioral notes field
- No structured tag selection UI

**Full Implementation (Post-MVP):**
- **FR22:** Behavior filter with predefined temperament tags: Friendly, Shy, Aggressive, Feral, Playful, Cautious
- **FR23:** Age Range filter with detailed options: Kitten (0-6mo), Young (6mo-2yr), Adult (2-7yr), Senior (7+yr)
- Multi-select tag UI with checkboxes
- Structured database fields for efficient filtering

**Rationale:** Free-text requires minimal UI work and backend schema; predefined tags need dropdown components, validation, and migration strategy.

---

### Activity Log Editing (FR44-FR45)

**MVP Implementation:**
- Activity logs are immutable once submitted (cannot be edited or deleted)
- If user makes mistake, they add a new corrective activity log with note explaining correction
- Photos are permanently attached to activity at submission time

**Full Implementation (Post-MVP):**
- **FR44:** Activity log creators can edit all details (category, action, notes, timestamp, photos)
- **FR45:** Add or remove photos from existing activity logs
- Edit history tracking (audit trail showing what was changed)

**Rationale:** Immutable logs are simpler (no edit UI, no version control, no conflict resolution) and actually provide better audit trail integrity.

---

### Implementation Strategy

**If Timeline Pressure Occurs:**
1. Implement MVP simplified versions first
2. Validate functionality with personal use
3. Gather pilot user feedback on what's actually needed
4. Prioritize full implementations based on real user pain points

**Upgrade Path:**
- All MVP simplifications can be enhanced without breaking existing data
- Free-text fields can be migrated to structured tags via data migration
- Immutable logs can become editable by adding edit functionality
- Independent search/filter can be combined with query builder

**Testing Note:** Simplified MVP versions are actually easier to test thoroughly, reducing bug risk during aggressive 1-month timeline.

## Post-MVP Feature Candidates

The following features were identified during requirements analysis as valuable enhancements for future versions, to be prioritized based on pilot testing feedback:

---

**Priority Note:** These features should be evaluated after MVP pilot testing to determine which provide the most value to actual users vs. theoretical benefits. User feedback will guide Phase 2 prioritization.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Paw Patrol aims for a **field-optimized, mobile-first experience** that prioritizes speed and simplicity over aesthetic polish. The interface should feel like a practical tool designed for volunteers working outdoors in challenging conditions—think "hiking GPS app" rather than "social media feed."

**Core UX Principles:**
- **One-handed operation:** All critical actions accessible with thumb reach on mobile
- **Glanceable information:** Key data (feeding status, TNR progress) visible without scrolling
- **Fast data entry:** Minimize taps and typing for common actions (logging feeding takes <10 seconds)
- **Forgiving interface:** Large touch targets, confirmation for destructive actions
- **Simple interactions:** Tap-only interface (no swipe gestures) suitable for non-power users

**Visual Language:**
- Clean, utilitarian design inspired by mapping/navigation apps (Google Maps, Waze)
- Photo-forward interface—cat images are primary navigation cues
- Status indicators using color coding (green = fed today, amber = needs attention, red = medical alert)
- Minimal decoration—every pixel serves a functional purpose

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Map as Home Base:**
- Map is the default landing screen after login (not a dashboard or list view)
- All primary actions flow FROM the map: tap pin → view details → take action
- Persistent search bar and filter icon always visible for quick access

**Bottom Sheet Navigation:**
- Hamburger menu icon (top-left) opens bottom sheet modal with primary navigation
- Bottom sheet contains: User profile, Log Out, Settings (future), Help
- Modal design—sheet slides up from bottom, can be dismissed by tapping outside or dragging down
- Post-MVP: Replace with proper dashboard screen

**Tap-to-Drill Hierarchy:**
- Map → Colony Details → Cat Profile (2 levels of actual navigation)
- Modals used for forms and actions (Add Cat, Log Activity, Filters) - not counted as navigation depth
- Back buttons at every level for predictable navigation
- Breadcrumb context shown in headers ("Colony Name > Cat Name")

**Quick Actions:**
- Long-press map to create colony (500ms)
- Floating action button (FAB) for "Log Activity" on detail screens and "+" for Add Colony on map
- Swipe gestures supported where natural (photo galleries, dismissing modals)
- Primary actions via taps and buttons for clarity

**Photo-Centric Identification:**
- Cat profile photos displayed as circular thumbnails (recognizable at small sizes)
- Gallery view for multiple photos with tap-to-expand
- Camera integration for instant photo capture from forms

**Smart Defaults:**
- Timestamp defaults to "now" but is user-editable
- Colony name auto-suggests from GPS address
- Filters default to "Active" status (hide adopted/deceased cats)

### Core Screens and Views

**1. Interactive Map (Home Screen)**
- Full-screen map with colony pins
- Hamburger menu icon (top-left) opens bottom sheet navigation
- Persistent search bar at top center
- Filter icon (top-right)
- "+" FAB for creating colonies (bottom-right)
- User location indicator
- Tutorial overlay on first launch

- Admin-only access

### Accessibility

**Target Level:** None (no formal WCAG compliance for MVP)

**Rationale:** Prioritizing speed to market for pilot testing. Basic best practices will be followed (semantic HTML, sufficient color contrast for outdoor visibility, keyboard navigation) but no formal accessibility audit or screen reader testing.

**Post-MVP Consideration:** If platform scales to include users with disabilities, implement WCAG AA compliance.

### Branding

**Visual Identity:**
- **No formal branding for MVP** - using Untitled UI component library defaults
- **Color Palette:** Rely on Untitled UI's neutral palette with functional status colors:
  - Green: Positive states (fed, healthy, neutered)
  - Amber/Yellow: Attention needed (medical alert, not fed recently)
  - Red: Urgent/critical (missing, medical emergency)
  - Blue: Informational (audit events, system messages)
- **Typography:** System fonts (San Francisco on iOS, Roboto on Android, -apple-system on web)
- **Iconography:** Standard Material Design or Untitled UI icon set

**Future Branding:** If adopted by rescue organizations, allow white-labeling or custom themes (logo upload, color palette customization).

### Target Device and Platforms

**Primary:** Web Responsive (mobile-first)
- Optimized for smartphone screens (375px-428px width)
- Functional on tablets and desktop but mobile is priority
- Touch-first interactions (large tap targets, no gestures required)

**Browser Support:** Last 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (mobile and desktop)

**No Native Apps:** Web-only for MVP for easier access with no installation required. Users access via browser URL. Progressive Web App (PWA) features could be added later for home screen installation and offline support if needed.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Decision:** Single repository with `/backend` and `/frontend` directories

**Rationale:**
- Solo developer project - simplifies dependency management and version control
- Easier to maintain consistency between API contracts and frontend implementations
- Single deployment pipeline for coordinated releases
- Natural fit for tightly coupled backend/frontend in MVP phase
- Can split to polyrepo later if needed for scale or team separation

### Service Architecture

**Architecture Pattern:** Monolithic backend

**Rationale:**
- 1-month MVP timeline requires fastest path to deployment
- Expected scale (10-20 colonies, 5-15 cats each) well within monolith capabilities
- Simpler debugging and testing than microservices
- Reduced operational complexity (single deployment unit)
- Database transactions easier to manage within monolithic boundary
- Can refactor to microservices post-MVP if scaling demands require it

**Technology Stack:**

**Backend:**
- **Language:** Java 17+
- **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.x
  - Spring Web (REST APIs)
  - Spring Security (authentication/authorization with JWT)
  - Spring Data JPA (ORM with Hibernate)
  - Spring Validation (input validation)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15+
  - Simple lat/long decimal fields for geolocation (no PostGIS complexity for MVP)
  - JSONB columns for flexible metadata if needed
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with 30-day expiration, BCrypt password hashing
- **File Storage:** Local filesystem for MVP (photos stored on Render persistent disk), migrate to cloud object storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2) post-MVP if needed

**Frontend:**
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Framework:** React 18+
- **Language:** JavaScript (TypeScript optional post-MVP if type safety becomes priority)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Component Library:** Untitled UI (pre-built components for rapid development)
- **State Management:** React Context API or Zustand (lightweight, avoid Redux complexity)
- **Mapping:** Google Maps JavaScript API integration
- **HTTP Client:** Axios or Fetch API
- **Form Handling:** React Hook Form (lightweight form validation)

**Deployment:**
- **Platform:** Render
  - Backend: Render Web Service (auto-deploy from Git)
  - Frontend: Render Static Site
  - Database: Render Managed PostgreSQL
- **Target Tier:** Free tier initially, upgrade to paid tier ($25-50/month) if resource limits exceeded
- **HTTPS:** Provided automatically by Render (Let's Encrypt certificates)
- **CI/CD:** Render's built-in Git integration (auto-deploy on push to main branch)

**External Services:**
- **Google Maps Platform:**
  - Maps JavaScript API (interactive map rendering)
  - Geocoding API (address → coordinates conversion)
  - Places API (location search and autocomplete)
  - Target: Stay within $200/month free tier credit during pilot
- **Email Service (for password reset):** SendGrid free tier or Render's SMTP relay

### Testing Requirements

**MVP Testing Strategy:** Unit testing only with manual testing convenience methods

**Rationale:**
- 1-month timeline prioritizes feature delivery over comprehensive test coverage
- Solo developer can manually test critical paths efficiently
- Full testing pyramid (unit + integration + E2E) deferred to post-MVP
- Risk mitigation: Aggressive manual testing before pilot launch

**Testing Tools:**
- **Backend:** JUnit 5, Mockito (Spring Boot Test starter included)
- **Frontend:** Vitest (Vite's native test runner), React Testing Library (optional)
- **Manual Testing Aids:**
  - Postman collection for API testing
  - Seed data scripts for populating test colonies/cats
  - Admin user creation script for bypassing verification during development

**Post-MVP Testing Goals:**
- Integration tests for critical API endpoints (auth, colony CRUD, activity logging)
- E2E tests for key user journeys (Playwright or Cypress)
- Contract testing between frontend and backend (Pact or OpenAPI validation)

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Security:**
- All API endpoints require authentication except registration, login, and password reset
- CORS configuration restricted to frontend domain (prevent unauthorized API access)
- SQL injection prevention via JPA parameterized queries
- File upload validation: whitelist image MIME types, max file size enforcement (5MB)
- XSS prevention via React's automatic escaping and Content Security Policy headers
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints (prevent brute force attacks)

**Data Modeling:**
- Soft deletes for cats and colonies (preserve referential integrity, support audit trail)
- Audit columns on all entities: created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at
- Activity logs immutable (no UPDATE/DELETE operations) for MVP audit trail integrity
- Photo storage: filename with UUID prefix to prevent collisions, metadata stored in database

**Performance Optimization:**
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields: colony coordinates, cat status, activity timestamps
- Pagination for activity logs (default 50 items per page)
- Image optimization: resize/compress uploads to max 1920px width, 80% JPEG quality
- Lazy loading for photo galleries (load thumbnails first, full resolution on demand)
- Map marker clustering for dense colony areas (Google Maps MarkerClusterer)

**Development Workflow:**
- Git branching: main branch for production, feature branches for development
- Code style: Google Java Style Guide (backend), Prettier + ESLint (frontend)
- Environment variables for secrets (database credentials, JWT secret, API keys)
- Local development: Docker Compose for PostgreSQL database (avoid local installation)

**API Design:**
- RESTful conventions: GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (remove)
- JSON request/response format
- Standardized error responses with status codes and messages
- API versioning via URL prefix `/api/v1/` (prepare for future breaking changes)

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Target: Last 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (mobile and desktop)
- Polyfills only if critical feature requires them (prefer modern browser APIs)
- No IE11 support (outdated, adds development complexity)

**Monitoring and Logging (MVP):**
- Backend: SLF4J with Logback (Spring Boot default)
- Log levels: ERROR for failures, WARN for concerning events, INFO for key operations
- Frontend: Console logging for errors (user-facing error messages for failures)
- Post-MVP: Centralized logging (Sentry, LogRocket) and application monitoring (Render metrics, New Relic)

- **Epic 1** establishes the foundation (project setup, security, user management) while delivering the registration and authentication workflow
- **Epic 2** builds the core map interface and colony management, which is the primary user entry point
- **Epic 3** adds cat profiles, which depend on colonies existing
- **Epic 4** adds activity logging and search, which depend on both colonies and cats existing
- **Epic 5** completes the platform with filtering and admin tools needed for pilot testing

**Epic Sizing:** Each epic is scoped for approximately 1 week of development effort in a 4-week timeline, with buffer time for testing and deployment.

**Alternative Consideration:** These 5 epics could be consolidated into 3-4 larger epics if you prefer fewer high-level milestones. For example:
- Merge Epic 2 & 3 into "Core Colony & Cat Management"
- Merge Epic 4 & 5 into "Activity Logging & Platform Completion"

## Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication

**Epic Goal:** Establish the foundational project infrastructure including monorepo setup, database configuration, deployment pipeline, and complete user authentication system with registration, login, password reset, and admin verification workflow. This epic delivers a deployable application where users can register, await approval, and authenticated users can access a basic landing page, providing the security foundation for all subsequent features.

1. Fed Today status calculated as: most recent feeding activity (category=FEEDING) timestamp is within last 24 hours from current time (rolling window per MVP scope clarification)
2. Backend query: `SELECT * FROM activities WHERE catId = ? AND category = 'FEEDING' ORDER BY activityTimestamp DESC LIMIT 1` and check if timestamp >= `now() - 24 hours`
3. Colony Details page displays "Last Fed" badge for each cat: "Fed 2 hours ago" (green) or "Not fed today" (amber/gray)
4. Cat Profile page displays "Last Fed" section with timestamp and color coding
5. Fed Today filter uses same rolling 24-hour logic
6. Status updates in real-time on page refresh (no caching of Fed Today status)
7. Future enhancement note: "Post-MVP: Replace rolling window with timezone-aware day boundary calculation (GMT+8 midnight reset) per FR20 full implementation"
8. Badge colors: Green if fed within 24 hours, amber if 24-48 hours, red if 48+ hours (visual indicator of urgency)

---

**Epic 5 Complete:** At this point, users can apply comprehensive filters (Status, Health & Feeding, TNR, Behavior, Basic Info) to find specific cats and colonies, with filter state persisting across sessions. Fed Today status accurately reflects recent feeding activities using rolling 24-hour calculation. Search and filters operate independently per MVP scope. All core MVP features are implemented and ready for pilot testing.

   - All choices include rationale and trade-off analysis

### Issues Identified

#### 🟡 High Priority (Should Address During Epic 1)

**1. Monitoring Strategy for MVP**
- **Issue:** No explicit monitoring/error tracking story in Epic 1
- **Impact:** Production issues will be invisible during pilot testing
- **Recommendation:** Add Story 1.12: "Configure Basic Logging & Error Tracking"
  - Acceptance Criteria: Backend structured logging to stdout, Frontend console error capture, Health check endpoint

**2. Pilot Tester Support Process**
- **Issue:** No defined process for pilot testers to report issues or provide feedback
- **Impact:** Unstructured feedback may lead to missed critical bugs
- **Recommendation:** Add section "Pilot Testing Support: GitHub Issues for bug reports, weekly feedback sessions, success metrics tracking"

#### 🟢 Medium Priority (Would Improve Clarity)

**3. Stakeholder Documentation**
- **Issue:** No explicit stakeholder list or approval process
- **Impact:** Reduces clarity about decision-making authority
- **Recommendation:** Add section listing: Solo Developer (owner), Pilot Testers (validators), Rescue Volunteers (end users)

**4. User Journey Diagrams**
- **Issue:** User flows described narratively but no visual diagrams
- **Impact:** Harder for architect to quickly grasp navigation patterns
- **Recommendation:** Add Mermaid diagrams for 3 core journeys (Feed Colony, Add Cat, Search)

#### 🔵 Low Priority (Nice to Have)

**5. Technical Risk Deep-Dive Areas**
- **Issue:** High-complexity areas not explicitly flagged for architect
- **Impact:** Minor - architect will identify during analysis
- **Recommendation:** Add note: "High Complexity: Google Maps integration, Haversine distance, concurrent edits"

### MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Appropriateness:** ✅ Just Right

**All Features Are Truly MVP:**
- Authentication with admin verification (security foundation) ✅
- Interactive map with colony pins (core value proposition) ✅
- Colony and cat CRUD operations (essential data management) ✅
- Activity logging (coordination value) ✅
- Search and filter (discovery essential) ✅
- Photo uploads (cat identification critical) ✅

**Complexity Concerns:**
- 🟡 **Google Maps API Integration** - Third-party dependency risk
  - *Mitigation:* $200/month free tier credit, cost monitoring required
- 🟡 **Haversine Distance Calculation** - Mathematical complexity
  - *Mitigation:* Well-documented algorithm, PostgreSQL native support
- 🟡 **Concurrent Edit Handling (FR46)** - Race condition management
  - *Mitigation:* Last-write-wins strategy is simplest, acceptable for MVP

**Timeline Realism (1 Month for Solo Developer):**
- Epic 1-3: Realistic (Spring Boot scaffolding is fast, CRUD is straightforward)
- Epic 4-5: Tight (Search algorithm and filter SQL have complexity)
- **Assessment:** Aggressive but achievable with focused execution; minimal buffer for blockers

### Technical Readiness for Architect

**What Architect Has to Work With:** ✅ Comprehensive
- Complete functional requirements (FR1-FR55) and non-functional requirements (NFR1-NFR18)
- 58 user stories with detailed acceptance criteria
- Full technology stack decisions with rationale
- MVP scope clarifications with post-MVP upgrade paths
- UI design goals and 10 core screen definitions
- Technical assumptions covering security, performance, development workflow

**Areas Needing Architect Investigation:**
1. Database schema design - entity relationships, indexing strategy, migrations
2. Google Maps integration architecture - API key management, rate limiting, error handling
3. Authentication flow - JWT token refresh strategy, session management
4. File upload architecture - storage location, image optimization pipeline
5. Search implementation - Haversine distance SQL optimization, result ranking
6. Filter query builder - complex SQL with multiple JOINs, performance optimization

**Identified Technical Risks:**
- Google Maps API cost monitoring (stay within $200/month free tier)
- File storage migration path (local filesystem MVP → S3/R2 post-MVP)
- Simplified geolocation (no PostGIS complexity for MVP)
- Concurrent edit handling (last-write-wins acceptable for MVP)

### Recommendations

**Before Architect Starts (High Priority):**
1. Add Story 1.12 to Epic 1: "Configure Basic Logging & Error Tracking" with acceptance criteria for backend structured logging, frontend error capture, and health check endpoint
2. Document pilot testing support process: GitHub Issues for bug reports, weekly feedback sessions

**During Architecture Phase (Medium Priority):**
3. Add stakeholder section: Solo Developer (owner), Pilot Testers, Rescue Volunteers
4. Create user journey diagrams for core workflows

**Post-MVP (Low Priority):**
5. Expand monitoring with centralized logging (Sentry, LogRocket)
6. Add disaster recovery and backup documentation

### Final Validation Decision

## Next Steps

### For UX Expert

You are being engaged to translate the Paw Patrol Product Requirements Document into a comprehensive user experience design that prioritizes field usability and rapid implementation.

**Your Mission:**
Design a mobile-first, field-optimized interface for community cat rescue volunteers that enables one-handed operation in challenging outdoor conditions while maintaining visual clarity and intuitive navigation.

**Context:**
- **Product:** Paw Patrol - GIS-based community cat colony tracking platform
- **Users:** Rescue volunteers in the Philippines working outdoors with limited connectivity
- **Timeline:** 1-month MVP development sprint (design must support rapid implementation)
- **Platform:** Web responsive (mobile-first), no native apps

**Key Design Constraints:**
1. **Field-First Design:** Large touch targets, high contrast for outdoor visibility, minimal data entry
2. **One-Handed Operation:** All critical actions within thumb reach on mobile devices
3. **Photo-Forward:** Cat images are primary navigation cues and identification method
4. **Speed Over Polish:** Functional, clean design prioritized over aesthetic refinement
5. **Technology:** Tailwind CSS + Untitled UI component library (use existing components)

**Reference Sections in PRD:**
- **UI Design Goals** (lines 393-443): Complete UX vision, interaction paradigms, 10 core screens
- **Functional Requirements** (FR1-FR55): All UI interactions and workflows
- **Epic Stories**: Detailed acceptance criteria for each screen and component

**Design Deliverables Needed:**
1. **High-Fidelity Mockups** for 10 core screens:
   - Interactive Map (home), Colony Details, Cat Profile, Add Cat Form, Log Activity Form, Filter Panel, Search Results, Admin Verification Panel, Login/Registration, Bottom Sheet Navigation
2. **Mobile Interaction Patterns:**
   - Long-press colony creation (500ms), FAB button placement, bottom sheet modal behavior, photo gallery swipe navigation
3. **Visual Design System:**
   - Color palette (status indicators: green/amber/red for feeding status, medical alerts)
   - Typography scale for mobile readability
   - Icon set (map pins, action buttons, status badges)
   - Component library usage guide (Untitled UI components)
4. **User Flow Diagrams** for 3 core journeys:
   - New User: Registration → Verification → First Colony Creation
   - Daily Feeding: Map → Colony Details → Log Activity → View Fed Today Status
   - TNR Coordination: Search → Filter by Unneutered → Cat Profile → Check TNR Info
5. **Responsive Breakpoints:**
   - Mobile: 375px-428px (primary)
   - Tablet: 768px-1024px (functional)
   - Desktop: 1280px+ (functional but not optimized)

**Critical UX Requirements:**
- Map load time <3 seconds (NFR1)
- Activity logging <10 seconds end-to-end (NFR2-3)
- No formal accessibility compliance required (NFR - "Target Level: None")
- Support last 2 versions Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

**Design Philosophy:**
Think "hiking GPS app" not "social media feed" - prioritize utility, speed, and clarity over aesthetic polish. Every pixel must serve a functional purpose. Design for volunteers wearing gloves, in bright sunlight, with one hand holding food/supplies.

**Success Criteria:**
- Designs can be implemented in 1 month using Tailwind CSS + Untitled UI
- Volunteers can log feeding activity in <10 seconds without looking at screen
- New users can create first colony within 2 minutes of login
- Zero training required for basic operations (search, view colony, log activity)

**Next Actions:**
1. Review full PRD (especially UI Design Goals and Epic Stories 2-5 for screen details)
2. Create mobile-first wireframes for 10 core screens
3. Design visual language (colors, typography, iconography)
4. Develop high-fidelity mockups with Untailed UI components
5. Document interaction patterns and component specifications for developer handoff

- **Scale:** 10-20 colonies, 5-15 cats each during pilot; plan for 100+ colonies post-MVP
- **Budget:** Render free tier initially → $25-50/month paid tier if needed

**Technology Stack (Pre-Selected):**
- **Backend:** Java 17+, Spring Boot 3.x, PostgreSQL 15+, JWT authentication
- **Frontend:** Vite, React 18+, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Untitled UI components
- **Deployment:** Render (Web Service + Static Site + Managed PostgreSQL)
- **External APIs:** Google Maps Platform (Maps, Geocoding, Places APIs)
- **Storage:** Local filesystem (Render persistent disk) for MVP → S3/R2 post-MVP

**Reference Sections in PRD:**
- **Technical Assumptions** (lines 467-585): Complete stack rationale, security, testing strategy
- **Functional Requirements** (FR1-FR55): All system capabilities and interactions
- **Non-Functional Requirements** (NFR1-NFR18): Performance, security, scalability targets
- **Epic Stories** (5 epics, 58 stories): Detailed acceptance criteria for implementation

**Architecture Deliverables Needed:**

1. **Database Schema Design:**
   - Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for: User, Colony, Cat, CatHealthInfo, CatTnrInfo, Activity, Photo entities
   - Foreign key relationships, indexes on query-heavy fields (lat/long, status, timestamps)
   - Audit trail strategy (createdBy, updatedBy, deletedAt for soft deletes)
   - Migration approach (Flyway or Liquibase)

2. **API Specification:**
   - RESTful endpoint design for all CRUD operations (colonies, cats, activities, photos, users)
   - Request/response schemas (JSON format)
   - Authentication flow (JWT token generation, refresh strategy, protected routes)
   - Error response standards (4xx client errors, 5xx server errors with consistent structure)
   - API versioning strategy (`/api/v1/` prefix)

3. **Component Architecture:**
   - React component hierarchy (Map, ColonyDetails, CatProfile, ActivityLog, FilterPanel, etc.)
   - State management approach (React Context API vs Zustand - recommend one with rationale)
   - Routing strategy (React Router with protected routes)
   - API integration layer (Axios with interceptors for auth token injection)

4. **Integration Architecture:**
   - Google Maps JavaScript API integration (API key management, rate limiting, error handling)
   - Geocoding API usage for reverse address lookup
   - Email service integration (SendGrid or SMTP for password reset)
   - File upload flow (multipart form data → validation → optimization → storage)

5. **Security Architecture:**
   - Authentication flow: Registration → Admin Verification → Login → JWT Token → Protected Resources
   - Password hashing (BCrypt), token signing (HMAC SHA256)
   - CORS configuration, CSRF protection strategy
   - File upload validation (MIME type whitelist, file size limits, malicious file prevention)
   - SQL injection prevention (JPA parameterized queries)

6. **Performance & Optimization Strategy:**
   - Database indexing plan (colonies: lat/long, cats: status, activities: timestamp)
   - Query optimization for complex filters (Status + Health + TNR + Behavior + Gender)
   - Image optimization pipeline (resize to 1920px, compress to 80% JPEG, generate thumbnails)
   - Map marker clustering for dense colony areas (MarkerClusterer)
   - Pagination strategy for activity logs (50 items per page)

7. **Deployment Architecture:**
   - Render Web Service configuration (build command, start command, environment variables)
   - Render Static Site configuration (build output directory, redirects for SPA routing)
   - Database connection pooling and migration execution
   - HTTPS configuration (automatic via Render/Let's Encrypt)
   - CI/CD pipeline (auto-deploy on Git push to main)

**Critical Technical Requirements:**
- Map load time <3 seconds on 4G (NFR1)
- Activity logging <2 seconds without photos, <5 seconds with photos (NFR2-3)
- Support 10-20 colonies without performance degradation (NFR17)
- Stay within Render free tier / Google Maps $200/month credit during pilot (NFR13-14)

**Known Technical Challenges:**
1. **Haversine Distance Calculation** (FR13, Story 4.10): Straight-line distance for search result proximity
   - Solution: PostgreSQL query with lat/long formula or PostGIS extension (if needed)
2. **Complex Filter Query Builder** (Epic 5): Multiple JOINs across Colony, Cat, CatHealthInfo, CatTnrInfo, Activity
   - Solution: JPA Criteria API or native SQL with proper indexing
3. **Concurrent Edit Handling** (FR46): Last-write-wins strategy for cat profiles and activities
   - Solution: Optimistic locking with version field or timestamp comparison
4. **Google Maps API Cost Monitoring**: Stay within free tier during pilot
   - Solution: Usage tracking, caching geocoding results, rate limiting

**MVP Simplifications to Preserve:**
- Search and filters operate independently (mutually exclusive, not combined) - Epic 5 Story 5.9
- Fed Today uses rolling 24-hour window (not timezone-aware day boundaries) - Epic 4 Story 4.9
- Activity logs are immutable (no edit/delete for MVP) - MVP Scope Clarification
- Behavioral notes are free-text (no predefined tags) - Epic 5 Story 5.5

**Post-MVP Upgrade Paths to Plan For:**
- Combined search + filter queries (FR15 full implementation)
- Timezone-aware Fed Today calculation (GMT+8 midnight reset)
- Editable activity logs with version history (FR44-45)
- Structured temperament tags and age ranges (FR22-23)
- Cloud object storage migration (S3/R2)

**Success Criteria:**
- Architecture supports 1-month implementation timeline
- Database schema is normalized and scalable to 100+ colonies
- API design is RESTful and enables future mobile app development
- Security architecture meets NFR6-10 requirements
- Performance targets (NFR1-3) are achievable with proposed design

**Next Actions:**
1. Review full PRD (especially Epic Stories for detailed acceptance criteria)
2. Design database schema with ERD and migration scripts
3. Define REST API endpoints with request/response specifications
4. Create component architecture diagram for React frontend
5. Document integration points (Google Maps, email, file storage)
6. Provide implementation guidance for high-complexity areas (Haversine distance, filter queries, concurrent edits)
7. Create deployment checklist for Render platform
